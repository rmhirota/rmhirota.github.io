## Hi there 👋

My name is Renata Hirota and I'm a statistician and data journalist based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

🔭 I’m currently a researcher at [ABJ](https://abj.org.br), where I work with jurimetrics, or the application of quantitative methods to law. I'm also an MSc student in statistics at the University of Sao Paulo.

🌱 I also occasionally work with data journalism, analysing data for stories or developing applications for journalistic purposes.

👩🏻‍💻 I love everything R and I'm part of R-Ladies Sao Paulo.

⚾️ My hobbies include playing baseball and D&D.
