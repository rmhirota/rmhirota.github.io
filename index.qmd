## Hi there 👋

My name is Renata Hirota and I'm a statistician and data journalist based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

🔭 I’m currently a data analyst at [Jusbrasil](https://www.jusbrasil.com.br), where I work with the application of quantitative and statistical methods to law.
I'm also an MSc student in statistics at the University of Sao Paulo.

🌱 I also work with data journalism occasionally, analysing data for stories or developing applications for journalistic purposes.

👩🏻‍💻 I love everything R and I'm part of R-Ladies.

⚾️ My hobbies include playing baseball and TTRPG.
