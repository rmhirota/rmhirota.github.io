Thankfully Day 2 was easier than Day 1; all you had to do was count red, green and blue balls and check some given conditions.\nFor the first part of the puzzle, you had to find all posible games given a number of balls (so you had to filter out games that exceeded that).\n\nFor example, the record of a few games might look like this:\nGame 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green\nGame 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue\nGame 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red\nGame 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red\nGame 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green\nIn game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is only 2 green cubes. The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAnswer for part 1, Day 2 – click to see my solution\n\n\n\n\n\ninput &lt;- \"aoc2023/02_cube_conundrum/input.txt\"\n\ninput |&gt;\n  readr::read_delim(col_names = c(\"game_id\", \"sets\"), show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    game_id = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(game_id, \"[0-9]+\")),\n    sets = stringr::str_split(sets, \";\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tidyr::unnest(sets) |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    green = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(sets, \"[0-9]+(?= green)\")),\n    blue = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(sets, \"[0-9]+(?= blue)\")),\n    red = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(sets, \"[0-9]+(?= red)\"))\n  ) |&gt;\n  tidyr::replace_na(list(green = 0, blue = 0, red = 0)) |&gt;\n  dplyr::group_by(game_id) |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(red &gt; 12 | green &gt; 13 | blue &gt; 14) |&gt;\n  dplyr::distinct(game_id, .keep_all = TRUE) |&gt;\n  dplyr::pull(game_id) |&gt;\n  setdiff(1:100, y = _) |&gt;\n  sum()\n\n\n\nFor part 2, you had to find the mininum number of balls of each color for each game.\n\nAs you continue your walk, the Elf poses a second question: in each game you played, what is the fewest number of cubes of each color that could have been in the bag to make the game possible? Again consider the example games from earlier:\nGame 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green\nGame 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue\nIn game 1, the game could have been played with as few as 4 red, 2 green, and 6 blue cubes. If any color had even one fewer cube, the game would have been impossible.\nGame 2 could have been played with a minimum of 1 red, 3 green, and 4 blue cubes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipAnswer for part 2, Day 2 – click to see my solution\n\n\n\n\n\ninput |&gt;\n  readr::read_delim(col_names = c(\"game_id\", \"sets\"), show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    game_id = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(game_id, \"[0-9]+\")),\n    sets = stringr::str_split(sets, \";\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tidyr::unnest(sets) |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    green = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(sets, \"[0-9]+(?= green)\")),\n    blue = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(sets, \"[0-9]+(?= blue)\")),\n    red = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(sets, \"[0-9]+(?= red)\"))\n  ) |&gt;\n  tidyr::replace_na(list(green = 0, blue = 0, red = 0)) |&gt;\n  dplyr::group_by(game_id) |&gt;\n  dplyr::summarise(max_red = max(red), max_green = max(green), max_blue = max(blue)) |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(power = max_red * max_green * max_blue) |&gt;\n  dplyr::pull(power) |&gt;\n  sum()\n\n\n\nIf you have any other ideas, feel free to tell me more on Mastodon or Bluesky.\nHappy coding! &lt;3"

    "text": "Photo by Timothy Dykes on Unsplash\nSince the Covid pandemic, I really got into D&D. I had never played before, but had friends who had long lasting parties and were DMs, so it was the perfect opportunity since we were all locked up in our houses.\nTurns out that it didn’t last more than a few months: we started one campaign at level 1 and disbanded shortly after reaching level 6. Then I found out about Critical Role and became a huge fan (although I’ve given up on Campaign 3…) and started playing with my partner and his friends.\nAs you can imagine, it wasn’t too long before I started DMing myself and I eventually started watching some of Matt Colville’s Twitch lives and YouTube videos (really recommend those for DMs!). So when Matt’s company MCDM started designing their own RPG, I was pretty excited (if you want to know more about it, you can listen to the podcast The Dice Society, which covers news on the development of the game).\nFor me, the game changer for this new RPG is the dice. Everyone who plays D&D, be it 5th edition, AD&D or anything in between, is used to rolling d20s, 20-sided dice1. On the other hand, MCDM’s RPG uses 2 regular, 6-sided dice for attacking, making ability checks and other situations in which your character might need to roll. As of now (March 2024), the game is still in development, so it still might change, but they made it very clear that they want to keep the 2d6 system in the final version of the game."

    "text": "Why I love the idea of the 2d6 system\nI know: d6s are kind of boring compared to d20s, right? Every Farkle and Yahtzee player uses them, after all. But to me, that could be a great advantage: it’s easy to understand and hit the ground running as soon as you know the basic rules, no need to go through weird dice2.\nAnd although I’ve become some sort of dice hoarder for the past years, I love the idea of rolling two dice, and more than that, two d6s, because of variance.\nLet’s assume we’re rolling a d20. The possible outcomes range from 1 to 20, and tecnically they all have the same probability, 1/20 = 5%. When rolling 2d6, there is a smaller range of possibilities (2 to 12) and they are not uniformally probable (you would expect to roll 12 much less frequently than 7, for example).\nThat means your modifier has a much more significant impact on the final result than sheer luck3. If you are consistently rolling some value near the mean (7), how good you are at a certain ability will more accurately translate to how successful you are in a skill check or attack. Sure, you can still fumble or do exceptionally well, but those events are less common."

    "text": "Simulating dice rolls\nI remember when I was younger and my Math teacher gave us an experiment: roll two dice 100 times and take note of the results. At the end of the class, we drew a bar plot with the results and found out that everyone drew basically the same plot.\nLet’s do the same, but with the RPG context and in a larger scale. We’ll check how the outcome of a character with a dexterity bonus of +3 would roll for a skill check using different dice systems. (MCDM’s stats are not exactly the same, but let’s just assume they are for this thought exercise.)\n\nRolling 1d20 1000 times\nAssuming that every side on a 20-sided die is physically the same, it’s fair to conclude that the numbers 1 through 20 have the same probability of being the outcome. Let’s imagine that we’re rolling the die 100 times and counting how many times each side appears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let’s do the same, rolling the die 1000 times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results seem random enough and there doesn’t seem to be a clear pattern. Even if we add the modifier (+3), it’s not that great a difference. The modifier matters much less then the roll of a die.\nAs a game design, it makes sense that extremely good (or bad) results are rare, but it’s weird that average outcomes are equally probable.\n\n\nRolling 2d6 1000 times\nIf we were rolling only one d6, we would have a similar situation: all 6 sides have the same probability. However, by adding two dice, we invoke the Central Limit Theorem!\nWhat is that, you ask? It’s one of the most important theorems in probability theory that says that, given a sample from a random variable under certain circumstances, the sample mean tends to follow a normal distribution, even if the original variable has a different distribution other than normal. More technically, the limit of a random variable X when n -&gt; Inf is normally distributed. More on that in the next section.\nFor now, let’s replicate the experiment we did with the d20, this time with 2d6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows what we’ve talked before: it’s much more common to roll a 7 than, say, a 12. The same goes for the other end of the curve, too.\nNow let’s take a look at what happens if we increase the number of rolls to a thousand:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd a million:"

(To me, at least.)\nOf course it’s fun to have some unpredictability when we’re playing, otherwise we would simply discard the dice. But it’s always frustrating when you know that your character is very good in a skill but you KEEP. ROLLING. ONES.\nAs a DM, it’s also hard to explain why that keeps happening in a way that makes sense narratively. “Oh, you see that the door is completely rotten but you simply can’t break it despite your Strength (20)” More especifically about D&D, it also creates some significant differences for classes such as Bard and Rogue.\nI think only time will tell if MCDM’s 2d6 system works for me in the long run. But for now, I’m excited about changing things up a little and depending a little less on my misbehaving dice."

So my regex would look something like\nrx &lt;- (\"[0-9]|one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine\")\nThen, I could switch the spelled out numbers, paste the first and last ones and sum them up.\nswitch_numbers &lt;- function(num) {\n  if (stringr::str_detect(num, \"[a-z]\")) {\n    result &lt;- switch(\n      num, one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four = 4, five = 5, six = 6, seven = 7,\n      eight = 8, nine = 9\n    )\n  } else {\n    result &lt;- num\n  }\n  as.numeric(result)\n}\n\ninput |&gt;\n  readr::read_csv(col_names = \"input\", show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(input != \"\") |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    numbers = stringr::str_extract_all(input, rx),\n    first = purrr::map_vec(numbers, head, n = 1),\n    last = purrr::map_vec(numbers, tail, n = 1),\n    first = purrr::map_vec(first, switch_numbers),\n    last = purrr::map_vec(last, switch_numbers),\n    calibration = as.numeric(paste0(first, last))\n  )|&gt;\n  dplyr::pull(calibration) |&gt;\n  sum()\nBut, turns out I was wrong. You can see the problem with str_extract_all in this case:\n&gt; stringr::str_extract_all(\"threeight\", rx)\n[[1]]\n[1] \"three\"\nWhat I actually wanted:\n[[1]]\n[1] \"three\"  [2] \"eight\"\nThe regex I was using does not take into account overlapping!\n\n\n\nThis takes us to attempt #2, where I try to take this problem into account with stringi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSecond try for part 2, Day 1 – click to see my solution\n\n\n\n\n\nswitch_numbers &lt;- function(num) {\n  if (stringr::str_detect(num, \"[a-z]\")) {\n    result &lt;- switch(\n      num, one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four = 4, five = 5, six = 6, seven = 7,\n      eight = 8, nine = 9\n    )\n  } else {\n    result &lt;- num\n  }\n  as.numeric(result)\n}\n\nrx &lt;- paste0(\"(?=([0-9]|\", paste(xfun::n2w(1:9), collapse = \"|\"), \"))\")\n\ninput |&gt;\n  readr::read_csv(col_names = \"input\", show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(input != \"\") |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    numbers = stringi::stri_match_all_regex(input, rx),\n    numbers = purrr::map(numbers, ~magrittr::extract(.x, ,2)),\n    first = purrr::map_vec(numbers, head, n = 1),\n    last = purrr::map_vec(numbers, tail, n = 1),\n    first = purrr::map_vec(first, switch_numbers),\n    last = purrr::map_vec(last, switch_numbers),\n    calibration = as.numeric(paste0(first, last))\n  ) |&gt;\n  dplyr::pull(calibration) |&gt;\n  sum()\nUsing a lookahead in the regex (?=) and stringi::stri_match_all_regex did the trick and got me to the right answer! 🥳\n\n\n\nIf you have any other ideas, feel free to tell me more on Mastodon or Bluesky.\nHappy coding! &lt;3"

    "section": "So, what happened at posit::conf?",
    "text": "So, what happened at posit::conf?\nI was (quite literally) speechless for most of the event (more on that later). It was so inspiring to see other Opportunity Scholars giving talks, sharing meals with fellow R nerds, and talking about everything that R allows us to do, from awesome presentations to great dataviz and reproducible modeling. It was also so nice to find common interests with various people outside of strictly professional topics.\nI don’t think I’ll be able to summarize all 4 days, but here goes nothing. The following is a short list of my personal highlights of the conference. If you want to have an overall view of Posit’s announcements, head over to Posit’s blog post where they listed their five takeaways from posit::conf(2023),\n\n1. Quarto, quarto and more quarto\nSo many things are happening with Quarto! I’m especially excited to try out typst, which promises to be friendlier than LaTeX. I also finally started this blog and website, which had been in my plans for years.\n\n\n2. DevOps for data scientists\nDevOps was my choice for the first two days of workshops. It’s a shame that, because it was a two-day workshop, that meant I couldn’t do two different workshops, but I regret nothing. I learned so much (who’s intimidated by Docker now?? Not me, that’s for sure. Well, maybe just a little bit, but hey, baby steps), and once I got home, the project I was working on during the workshop evolved into this website. I bought the domain a few months back, and this was the push I needed to actually do something with it.\n\n\n3. R-Ladies are awesome\n\n\n\nR-Ladies gathered at the Hyatt for Q&A\n\n\nI’m part of the local chapter of R-Ladies in Sao Paulo but had little to no interaction with the global team. The R-Ladies meetup on the last day was a great opportunity to better understand the workings of the organization and be inspired by awesome people who do such important work within the R community. More details of the meetup are available at this blog post.\n\n\n4. The Discord server\nBeing in a place with hundreds of people can be a little overwhelming. I found that the posit::conf Discord server was a great way to start a conversation (kudos for the foodie channel!) in a more controlled environment – while also keeping track of sticker drops!"

    "text": "Tips and hot takes\nThere are also a few things that I wanted to share with other people planning to attend next year.\n\n1. If you’re an introvert, know that there are others like you\nYes, you, the person standing awkwardly in a corner while everyone else is mingling and seems to be having a great time. There are other people doing exactly the same. Try to approach them with some questions, maybe? Here are some basic conversation starters once you’re past the “what do you do for work” stage that are not too boring but also not too unrealistic:\n\nWhat talks did you like the most so far?\nWhat did you learn that you are excited to try?\nWhat’s your favorite R package?\nWhat is the R community like where you’re based?\nIs it your first time in {city}? Do you have any plans apart from the conf?\n\n\n\n2. Don’t assume people know the same things you do\nTalking to people who are very knowledgeable can be either intimidating or mind-opening. I had a great time talking to a much more experienced developer who explained so much about their project in a friendly way that I felt welcomed to share my thoughts and ask questions. Be mindful not to be the arrogant person (even if unconsciously) who assumes people know what you’re talking about.\n\n\n3. It’s OK to take a break\nBy the end of the second day, I was physically and mentally exhausted. To be honest, I was recovering from a cold a few days before my flight, and was feeling great, but two days of talking non-stop, some alcohol and early mornings made me so hoarse I could barely hear myself speak.\nSo I decided to skip some talks (that I knew would be recorded anyway, so I could catch up later) and rested. During one of my breaks, I had a lovely time making friendship bracelets at the arts and crafts table with other people who were recharging their social batteries. I’m also not much of a morning person, so I purposefully missed breakfast on the last day to have tea and some quiet time by myself outside the hotel.\n\n\n\nSaying farewell to posit::conf(2023)\n\n\nIt was absolutely amazing to attend posit::conf(2023). Next year it’s going to be in Seattle and I’m already thinking about how I’m going to be there. Fingers crossed for getting a talk acceppted! 🤞"

    "text": "Photo by Ilse on Unsplash\nAlmost every year, I go through the same ritual of reflecting on what the past year meant to me, both on a professional and personal level. Accomplishments, work related projects and awards, things I learned, meaningful experiences, and so on.\nI don’t usually share those reflections, limiting myself to Spotify Wrapped and other silly year-end summaries. However, I thought it would be nice to share something more personal this time around.\n2025 was a very busy year. I’ve noticed that every year seems to get busier, but oh boy, I really felt it with my whole body this year. In January, I was three months into a new job, and I was still trying to get the hang of things, getting used to new processes (or lack thereof), and learning the ropes of a new team. Mind you, this was in addition to a part-time job I had been doing for almost a year already, and a master’s degree that I was still trying to finish.\nMy niece was born in December 2024, and all I wanted was to visit every week. I moved to a new apartment in March 2025. I had three international trips, attended three or four weddings, spoke at two major conferences, won a journalism award, got engaged, started (a few) new hobbies, started planning for a wedding, planning for a surprise birthday party for my sister, planning for I don’t know how many other things… It was a LOT.\nSo this year, I wanted to share some of the things I decided to let go in 2025, things that no longer fit in my life, not because I don’t like them anymore, but because I simply don’t have the time or energy to dedicate to them. It took me a while to finally accept that not only my time but also my energy is finite (shocking) and I really need to protect them both."

    "section": "1. Working two jobs",
    "text": "1. Working two jobs\nThis was one of the hardest decision I had to make last year. I studied journalism and fresh out of college I shared the frustration of many of my peers about the lack of good paying jobs in the field. I ended up starting over and going back to college to study statistics, which ironically opened many doors for me in the tech industry – but also in data journalism, I field I didn’t even know existed.\nI used to juggle classes, an internship, data journalism projects as a freelancer, and baseball practice, and although I wasn’t failing anything, I felt I wasn’t giving my all to none of them. Then the covid pandemic struck, time warped and nothing made sense anymore. I somehow graduated (thanks to friends who studied with me and explained me SO many things), and I thought things would be quieter, but I just filled whatever time I had gotten back from classes with… more work.\nI couldn’t say no to data journalism projects that were so interesting, but I didn’t want to forgo a formal job. So I kept stacking things up for years, having anxiety crises every other week – did I mention I started a master’s in statistics because I missed studying? – until last year I started having constant heartburn. I had gained 10 kg, I had stopped exercising (I still miss baseball on Saturdays), and was constantly frustrated about “not having time” and doing everything half-assedly.\nMy therapist was suspicious of an undiagnosed ADHD, so on top of that I started seeing a psychiatrist, and after a few months I made a deal with myself, my partner, my therapist and my psychiatrist: I had to let go of something.\nSo that’s how I ended up having only one job for the first time in a decade! It was weird at first, but it unlocked a new joy: having time for weekly family dinner with my niece. It’s so simple but it makes me so happy that I wouldn’t give it up for anything, and I see that now."

Finishing my thesis in 2025\nIt’s ridiculous that I’ve done all the credits for my MsC (I even took summer classes so I wouldn’t be too swamped during the semester), but can’t sit down to write my thesis. It took me months to decide on a theme, then I changed it 2 or 3 times just for good measure, and once I settled… Nothing. I kept postponing and cancelling meetings with my advisor and now with the deadline looming, I decided to take a leave for a year.\nI’m lucky my advisor is so kind and understanding, and even suggested we keep working on it during this time if I wanted to, without the pressure of the deadline. I’m planning the next few months and we’ll see how it goes."

    "text": "3. Home-cooked meals every single day\nSome people don’t care about food, as long as it’s nourishing and/or tasty. I’m not one of those people. I care deeply – cooking and eating give me joy, whether it is with people or by myself.\nWhen I first moved out of my parent’s house, I struggled to establish a routine that would allow for all the hassle that is cooking at home. Grocery shopping, managing expiry dates, planning for the week, balancing nutrients – it might be simple, but it’s a lot. But I eventually managed to find my rhythm.\nThen my partner moved in with me and… well, let’s just say that those 10 kg I gained were not only due to stress and anxiety. My eating habits changed, my metabolism changed with age, and in my mind I kept stressing that home-cooked meal = good, everything else = bad.\nI still like cooking, don’t get me wrong. And I still think nothing beats a healthy homemade meal. But I admit now that, as much as I want to, I don’t have the time or energy to cook every meal, everyday. We do what we can, and when we can’t, we use plans B or C (which is having a freezer stocked with packed lunch and ordering healthy-ish takeout). I also simplified groceries: I have a subscription that deliveries organic fruit, vegetables and eggs every two weeks, so we have less things to worry about when making a grocery list."

Now they know that if something is important and can’t wait for a few hours, they should call me, like in the 1900s.\nI keep forgetting my phone at home, the battery is out at least once a week because I forgot to check – but I love it! I feel I talk more with my family, instead of just texting, and meet friends more regularly.
