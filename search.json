Breathing, especially in municipalities in the states of Rond√¥nia, Mato Grosso, Acre and Amazonas, has become more dangerous.\nThis toxic synergy was the object of an unprecedented data analysis carried out by a multidisciplinary team of journalists, geographers, statisticians from InfoAmazonia, in partnership with researchers from LabGama, from the Federal University of Acre, and Fiocruz‚Äôs Climate and Health Observatory/ICICT. The project was supported by Stanford University through the Big Local News program, which aims to open up data in formats that can be replicated by journalists around the world.\nLearn more about this project here."

Of the 72 indigenous territories in the state, 21 were found to contain commodity crops, raising concerns about leases, invasions, and ongoing legal disputes. This unprecedented insight into the intersection of agriculture and indigenous lands underscores the complex dynamics at play in Mato Grosso.\nThe interactive maps featured in the story were made by me with Leaflet from the original data provided by the researchers.\nRead more here."

    "text": "So, what happened at posit::conf?\nI was (quite literally) speechless for most of the event (more on that later). It was so inspiring to see other Opportunity Scholars giving talks, sharing meals with fellow R nerds, and talking about everything that R allows us to do, from awesome presentations to great dataviz and reproducible modeling. It was also so nice to find common interests with various people outside of strictly professional topics.\nI don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to summarize all 4 days, but here goes nothing. The following is a short list of my personal highlights of the conference. If you want to have an overall view of Posit‚Äôs announcements, head over to Posit‚Äôs blog post where they listed their five takeaways from posit::conf(2023),\n\n1. Quarto, quarto and more quarto\nSo many things are happening with Quarto! I‚Äôm especially excited to try out typst, which promises to be friendlier than LaTeX. I also finally started this blog and website, which had been in my plans for years.\n\n\n2. DevOps for data scientists\nDevOps was my choice for the first two days of workshops. It‚Äôs a shame that, because it was a two-day workshop, that meant I couldn‚Äôt do two different workshops, but I regret nothing. I learned so much (who‚Äôs intimidated by Docker now?? Not me, that‚Äôs for sure. Well, maybe just a little bit, but hey, baby steps), and once I got home, the project I was working on during the workshop evolved into this website. I bought the domain a few months back, and this was the push I needed to actually do something with it.\n\n\n3. R-Ladies are awesome\n\n\n\nR-Ladies gathered at the Hyatt for Q&A\n\n\nI‚Äôm part of the local chapter of R-Ladies in Sao Paulo but had little to no interaction with the global team. The R-Ladies meetup on the last day was a great opportunity to better understand the workings of the organization and be inspired by awesome people who do such important work within the R community. More details of the meetup are available at this blog post.\n\n\n4. The Discord server\nBeing in a place with hundreds of people can be a little overwhelming. I found that the posit::conf Discord server was a great way to start a conversation (kudos for the foodie channel!) in a more controlled environment ‚Äì while also keeping track of sticker drops!"

    "text": "Tips and hot takes\nThere are also a few things that I wanted to share with other people planning to attend next year.\n\n1. If you‚Äôre an introvert, know that there are others like you\nYes, you, the person standing awkwardly in a corner while everyone else is mingling and seems to be having a great time. There are other people doing exactly the same. Try to approach them with some questions, maybe? Here are some basic conversation starters once you‚Äôre past the ‚Äúwhat do you do for work‚Äù stage that are not too boring but also not too unrealistic:\n\nWhat talks did you like the most so far?\nWhat did you learn that you are excited to try?\nWhat‚Äôs your favorite R package?\nWhat is the R community like where you‚Äôre based?\nIs it your first time in {city}? Do you have any plans apart from the conf?\n\n\n\n2. Don‚Äôt assume people know the same things you do\nTalking to people who are very knowledgeable can be either intimidating or mind-opening. I had a great time talking to a much more experienced developer who explained so much about their project in a friendly way that I felt welcomed to share my thoughts and ask questions. Be mindful not to be the arrogant person (even if unconsciously) who assumes people know what you‚Äôre talking about.\n\n\n3. It‚Äôs OK to take a break\nBy the end of the second day, I was physically and mentally exhausted. To be honest, I was recovering from a cold a few days before my flight, and was feeling great, but two days of talking non-stop, some alcohol and early mornings made me so hoarse I could barely hear myself speak.\nSo I decided to skip some talks (that I knew would be recorded anyway, so I could catch up later) and rested. During one of my breaks, I had a lovely time making friendship bracelets at the arts and crafts table with other people who were recharging their social batteries. I‚Äôm also not much of a morning person, so I purposefully missed breakfast on the last day to have tea and some quiet time by myself outside the hotel.\n\n\n\nSaying farewell to posit::conf(2023)\n\n\nIt was absolutely amazing to attend posit::conf(2023). Next year it‚Äôs going to be in Seattle and I‚Äôm already thinking about how I‚Äôm going to be there. Fingers crossed for getting a talk acceppted! ü§û"

    "text": "Photo by Timothy Dykes on Unsplash\nSince the Covid pandemic, I really got into D&D. I had never played before, but had friends who had long lasting parties and were DMs, so it was the perfect opportunity since we were all locked up in our houses.\nTurns out that it didn‚Äôt last more than a few months: we started one campaign at level 1 and disbanded shortly after reaching level 6. Then I found out about Critical Role and became a huge fan (although I‚Äôve given up on Campaign 3‚Ä¶) and started playing with my partner and his friends.\nAs you can imagine, it wasn‚Äôt too long before I started DMing myself and I eventually started watching some of Matt Colville‚Äôs Twitch lives and YouTube videos (really recommend those for DMs!). So when Matt‚Äôs company MCDM started designing their own RPG, I was pretty excited (if you want to know more about it, you can listen to the podcast The Dice Society, which covers news on the development of the game).\nFor me, the game changer for this new RPG is the dice. Everyone who plays D&D, be it 5th edition, AD&D or anything in between, is used to rolling d20s, 20-sided dice1. On the other hand, MCDM‚Äôs RPG uses 2 regular, 6-sided dice for attacking, making ability checks and other situations in which your character might need to roll. As of now (March 2024), the game is still in development, so it still might change, but they made it very clear that they want to keep the 2d6 system in the final version of the game."

    "text": "Why I love the idea of the 2d6 system\nI know: d6s are kind of boring compared to d20s, right? Every Farkle and Yahtzee player uses them, after all. But to me, that could be a great advantage: it‚Äôs easy to understand and hit the ground running as soon as you know the basic rules, no need to go through weird dice2.\nAnd although I‚Äôve become some sort of dice hoarder for the past years, I love the idea of rolling two dice, and more than that, two d6s, because of variance.\nLet‚Äôs assume we‚Äôre rolling a d20. The possible outcomes range from 1 to 20, and tecnically they all have the same probability, 1/20 = 5%. When rolling 2d6, there is a smaller range of possibilities (2 to 12) and they are not uniformally probable (you would expect to roll 12 much less frequently than 7, for example).\nThat means your modifier has a much more significant impact on the final result than sheer luck3. If you are consistently rolling some value near the mean (7), how good you are at a certain ability will more accurately translate to how successful you are in a skill check or attack. Sure, you can still fumble or do exceptionally well, but those events are less common."

    "text": "Simulating dice rolls\nI remember when I was younger and my Math teacher gave us an experiment: roll two dice 100 times and take note of the results. At the end of the class, we drew a bar plot with the results and found out that everyone drew basically the same plot.\nLet‚Äôs do the same, but with the RPG context and in a larger scale. We‚Äôll check how the outcome of a character with a dexterity bonus of +3 would roll for a skill check using different dice systems. (MCDM‚Äôs stats are not exactly the same, but let‚Äôs just assume they are for this thought exercise.)\n\nRolling 1d20 1000 times\nAssuming that every side on a 20-sided die is physically the same, it‚Äôs fair to conclude that the numbers 1 through 20 have the same probability of being the outcome. Let‚Äôs imagine that we‚Äôre rolling the die 100 times and counting how many times each side appears.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let‚Äôs do the same, rolling the die 1000 times.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results seem random enough and there doesn‚Äôt seem to be a clear pattern. Even if we add the modifier (+3), it‚Äôs not that great a difference. The modifier matters much less then the roll of a die.\nAs a game design, it makes sense that extremely good (or bad) results are rare, but it‚Äôs weird that average outcomes are equally probable.\n\n\nRolling 2d6 1000 times\nIf we were rolling only one d6, we would have a similar situation: all 6 sides have the same probability. However, by adding two dice, we invoke the Central Limit Theorem!\nWhat is that, you ask? It‚Äôs one of the most important theorems in probability theory that says that, given a sample from a random variable under certain circumstances, the sample mean tends to follow a normal distribution, even if the original variable has a different distribution other than normal. More technically, the limit of a random variable X when n -&gt; Inf is normally distributed. More on that in the next section.\nFor now, let‚Äôs replicate the experiment we did with the d20, this time with 2d6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows what we‚Äôve talked before: it‚Äôs much more common to roll a 7 than, say, a 12. The same goes for the other end of the curve, too.\nNow let‚Äôs take a look at what happens if we increase the number of rolls to a thousand:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd a million:"

But it‚Äôs always frustrating when you know that your character is very good in a skill but you KEEP. ROLLING. ONES.\nAs a DM, it‚Äôs also hard to explain why that keeps happening in a way that makes sense narratively. ‚ÄúOh, you see that the door is completely rotten but you simply can‚Äôt break it despite your Strength (20)‚Äù More especifically about D&D, it also creates some significant differences for classes such as Bard and Rogue.\nI think only time will tell if MCDM‚Äôs 2d6 system works for me in the long run.

Thankfully Day 2 was easier than Day 1; all you had to do was count red, green and blue balls and check some given conditions.\nFor the first part of the puzzle, you had to find all posible games given a number of balls (so you had to filter out games that exceeded that).\n\nFor example, the record of a few games might look like this:\nGame 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green\nGame 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue\nGame 3: 8 green, 6 blue, 20 red; 5 blue, 4 red, 13 green; 5 green, 1 red\nGame 4: 1 green, 3 red, 6 blue; 3 green, 6 red; 3 green, 15 blue, 14 red\nGame 5: 6 red, 1 blue, 3 green; 2 blue, 1 red, 2 green\nIn game 1, three sets of cubes are revealed from the bag (and then put back again). The first set is 3 blue cubes and 4 red cubes; the second set is 1 red cube, 2 green cubes, and 6 blue cubes; the third set is only 2 green cubes. The Elf would first like to know which games would have been possible if the bag contained only 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer for part 1, Day 2 ‚Äì click to see my solution\n\n\n\n\n\ninput &lt;- \"aoc2023/02_cube_conundrum/input.txt\"\n\ninput |&gt;\n  readr::read_delim(col_names = c(\"game_id\", \"sets\"), show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    game_id = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(game_id, \"[0-9]+\")),\n    sets = stringr::str_split(sets, \";\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tidyr::unnest(sets) |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    green = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(sets, \"[0-9]+(?= green)\")),\n    blue = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(sets, \"[0-9]+(?= blue)\")),\n    red = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(sets, \"[0-9]+(?= red)\"))\n  ) |&gt;\n  tidyr::replace_na(list(green = 0, blue = 0, red = 0)) |&gt;\n  dplyr::group_by(game_id) |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(red &gt; 12 | green &gt; 13 | blue &gt; 14) |&gt;\n  dplyr::distinct(game_id, .keep_all = TRUE) |&gt;\n  dplyr::pull(game_id) |&gt;\n  setdiff(1:100, y = _) |&gt;\n  sum()\n\n\n\nFor part 2, you had to find the mininum number of balls of each color for each game.\n\nAs you continue your walk, the Elf poses a second question: in each game you played, what is the fewest number of cubes of each color that could have been in the bag to make the game possible? Again consider the example games from earlier:\nGame 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 2 green\nGame 2: 1 blue, 2 green; 3 green, 4 blue, 1 red; 1 green, 1 blue\nIn game 1, the game could have been played with as few as 4 red, 2 green, and 6 blue cubes. If any color had even one fewer cube, the game would have been impossible.\nGame 2 could have been played with a minimum of 1 red, 3 green, and 4 blue cubes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer for part 2, Day 2 ‚Äì click to see my solution\n\n\n\n\n\ninput |&gt;\n  readr::read_delim(col_names = c(\"game_id\", \"sets\"), show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    game_id = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(game_id, \"[0-9]+\")),\n    sets = stringr::str_split(sets, \";\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tidyr::unnest(sets) |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    green = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(sets, \"[0-9]+(?= green)\")),\n    blue = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(sets, \"[0-9]+(?= blue)\")),\n    red = as.numeric(stringr::str_extract(sets, \"[0-9]+(?= red)\"))\n  ) |&gt;\n  tidyr::replace_na(list(green = 0, blue = 0, red = 0)) |&gt;\n  dplyr::group_by(game_id) |&gt;\n  dplyr::summarise(max_red = max(red), max_green = max(green), max_blue = max(blue)) |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(power = max_red * max_green * max_blue) |&gt;\n  dplyr::pull(power) |&gt;\n  sum()\n\n\n\nIf you have any other ideas, feel free to tell me more on Mastodon or Bluesky.\nHappy coding! &lt;3"

Maybe this is the year I get to the second week? (Nevermind that I‚Äôm already late.)\nI still have a full week ahead of exams and papers, so I‚Äôll probably take it slow, but I wanted to lay the groundwork. I‚Äôm starting by installing {aor}, which is a neat R package with some useful functions to help you with Advent of Code, so you can focus on actually solving the puzzles.\nOnce installed and with the right cookie configurations (all explained in aor‚Äôs readme), I can simply run\n‚Ä¶and I‚Äôll have a directory for that day‚Äôs puzzle, with a template for the code and the input text! It‚Äôs important to note that you must be logged in to get the puzzle input, as they are different across users.\nNext step is solving the puzzles. I‚Äôm starting with day one."

    "text": "Day 1: Trebuchet?!\nTo sum things up, the first part of day 1 is:\n\nRead a file with text\nIdentify the first and last numbers on each line (the ‚Äúcalibration‚Äù) and sum them up\n\nEvery puzzle comes with a minimal example:\n\nFor example:\n1abc2\npqr3stu8vwx\na1b2c3d4e5f\ntreb7uchet\nIn this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.\n\nThere are many ways this can be done, but I ended up using dplyr because I‚Äôm more used to it. With a little bit of regex, it was easy enough to extract the numbers that I needed to clear part 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer for part 1, Day 1 ‚Äì click to see my solution\n\n\n\n\n\ninput &lt;- \"aoc2023/01_trebuchet/input.txt\"\ninput |&gt;\n  readr::read_csv(col_names = \"input\", show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(input != \"\") |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    first = stringr::str_extract(input, \"[0-9]\"),\n    last = stringr::str_extract(input, \"[0-9](?!.*[0-9])\"),\n    calibration = as.numeric(paste0(first, last))\n  ) |&gt;\n  dplyr::pull(calibration) |&gt;\n  sum()\n\n\n\nPart 2 was a little bit trickier. The puzzle says:\n\nYour calculation isn‚Äôt quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid ‚Äúdigits‚Äù. Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:\ntwo1nine\neightwothree\nabcone2threexyz\nxtwone3four\n4nineeightseven2\nzoneight234\n7pqrstsixteen\nIn this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. Adding these together produces 281.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst try for part 2, Day 1 ‚Äì click to see my failed attempt\n\n\n\n\n\nMy first idea was using regex to get all ocurrences of numbers and spelled out numbers. So my regex would look something like\nrx &lt;- (\"[0-9]|one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine\")\nThen, I could switch the spelled out numbers, paste the first and last ones and sum them up.\nswitch_numbers &lt;- function(num) {\n  if (stringr::str_detect(num, \"[a-z]\")) {\n    result &lt;- switch(\n      num, one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four = 4, five = 5, six = 6, seven = 7,\n      eight = 8, nine = 9\n    )\n  } else {\n    result &lt;- num\n  }\n  as.numeric(result)\n}\n\ninput |&gt;\n  readr::read_csv(col_names = \"input\", show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(input != \"\") |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    numbers = stringr::str_extract_all(input, rx),\n    first = purrr::map_vec(numbers, head, n = 1),\n    last = purrr::map_vec(numbers, tail, n = 1),\n    first = purrr::map_vec(first, switch_numbers),\n    last = purrr::map_vec(last, switch_numbers),\n    calibration = as.numeric(paste0(first, last))\n  )|&gt;\n  dplyr::pull(calibration) |&gt;\n  sum()\nBut, turns out I was wrong. You can see the problem with str_extract_all in this case:\n&gt; stringr::str_extract_all(\"threeight\", rx)\n[[1]]\n[1] \"three\"\nWhat I actually wanted:\n[[1]]\n[1] \"three\"  [2] \"eight\"\nThe regex I was using does not take into account overlapping!\n\n\n\nThis takes us to attempt #2, where I try to take this problem into account with stringi.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond try for part 2, Day 1 ‚Äì click to see my solution\n\n\n\n\n\nswitch_numbers &lt;- function(num) {\n  if (stringr::str_detect(num, \"[a-z]\")) {\n    result &lt;- switch(\n      num, one = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four = 4, five = 5, six = 6, seven = 7,\n      eight = 8, nine = 9\n    )\n  } else {\n    result &lt;- num\n  }\n  as.numeric(result)\n}\n\nrx &lt;- paste0(\"(?=([0-9]|\", paste(xfun::n2w(1:9), collapse = \"|\"), \"))\")\n\ninput |&gt;\n  readr::read_csv(col_names = \"input\", show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(input != \"\") |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    numbers = stringi::stri_match_all_regex(input, rx),\n    numbers = purrr::map(numbers, ~magrittr::extract(.x, ,2)),\n    first = purrr::map_vec(numbers, head, n = 1),\n    last = purrr::map_vec(numbers, tail, n = 1),\n    first = purrr::map_vec(first, switch_numbers),\n    last = purrr::map_vec(last, switch_numbers),\n    calibration = as.numeric(paste0(first, last))\n  ) |&gt;\n  dplyr::pull(calibration) |&gt;\n  sum()\nUsing a lookahead in the regex (?=) and stringi::stri_match_all_regex did the trick and got me to the right answer! ü•≥\n\n\n\nIf you have any other ideas, feel free to tell me more on Mastodon or Bluesky.\nHappy coding! &lt;3"
