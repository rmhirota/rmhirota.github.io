# --- Day 1: Trebuchet?! ---
#
# Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected
# to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used
# stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having
# problems.
#
# You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow
# operations, you need to check all *fifty stars* by December 25th.
#
# Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on
# each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you
# complete the first. Each puzzle grants *one star*. Good luck!
#
# You try to ask why they can't just use a [weather machine](/2015/day/1)
# ("not powerful enough") and where they're even sending you ("the sky")
# and why your map looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions")
# and^[My hope is that this abomination of a run-on sentence somehow
# conveys the chaos of being hastily loaded into a trebuchet.] hang on
# did you just say the sky ("of course, where do you think snow comes
# from") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a
# [trebuchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet) ("please hold
# still, we need to strap you in").
#
# As they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their
# calibration document (your puzzle input) has been *amended* by a very
# young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills.
# Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the
# document.
#
# The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each
# line originally contained a specific *calibration value* that the Elves
# now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by
# combining the *first digit* and the *last digit* (in that order) to form
# a single *two-digit number*.
#
# For example:
#
#     1abc2
#     pqr3stu8vwx
#     a1b2c3d4e5f
#     treb7uchet
#
# In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are `12`,
# `38`, `15`, and `77`. Adding these together produces *`142`*.
#
# Consider your entire calibration document. *What is the sum of all of
# the calibration values?*

# Your input can be found on the file below:
input <- "aoc2023/01_trebuchet/input.txt"

input |>
  readr::read_csv(col_names = "input", show_col_types = FALSE) |>
  dplyr::filter(input != "") |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    first = stringr::str_extract(input, "[0-9]"),
    last = stringr::str_extract(input, "[0-9](?!.*[0-9])"),
    calibration = as.numeric(paste0(first, last))
  ) |>
  dplyr::pull(calibration) |>
  sum()


# Once you're done with part 1, run the following line to fetch part 2:
aor::day_continue("2023-12-01", "aoc2023/01_trebuchet/puzzle.R")

# --- Part Two ---
#
# Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are
# actually *spelled out with letters*: `one`, `two`, `three`, `four`,
# `five`, `six`, `seven`, `eight`, and `nine` *also* count as valid
# "digits".
#
# Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first
# and last digit on each line. For example:
#
#     two1nine
#     eightwothree
#     abcone2threexyz
#     xtwone3four
#     4nineeightseven2
#     zoneight234
#     7pqrstsixteen
#
# In this example, the calibration values are `29`, `83`, `13`, `24`,
# `42`, `14`, and `76`. Adding these together produces *`281`*.
#
# *What is the sum of all of the calibration values?*
