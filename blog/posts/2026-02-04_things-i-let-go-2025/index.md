Almost every year, I go through the same ritual of reflecting on what the past
year meant to me, both on a professional and personal level. Accomplishments, 
work related projects and awards, things I learned, meaningful experiences, and 
so on.

I don't usually share those reflections, limiting myself to Spotify Wrapped and
other silly year-end summaries. However, I thought it would be nice to share
something more personal this time around.

2025 was a _very busy_ year. I've noticed that every year seems to get busier,
but oh boy, I really _felt_ it with my whole body this year. In January, I was
three months into a new job, and I was still trying to get the hang of things, 
getting used to new processes (or lack thereof), and learning the ropes of a new 
team. Mind you, this was in addition to a part-time job I had been doing for 
almost a year already, and a master's degree that I was still trying to finish.

My niece was born in December 2024, and all I wanted was to visit every week. 
I moved to a new apartment in March 2025. I had three international trips, 
attended three or four weddings, spoke at two major conferences, won a 
journalism award, got engaged, started (a few) new hobbies, started _planning_ 
for a wedding, planning for a surprise birthday party for my sister, planning 
for I don't know how many other things... It was a LOT.

So this year, I wanted to share some of the things I decided to let go in 2025, 
things that no longer fit in my life, not because I don't like them anymore, but
because I simply don't have the time or energy to dedicate to them. It took me a 
while to finally accept that not only my time but also my energy is _finite_ 
(shocking) and I really need to protect them both.

## 1. Working two jobs

This was one of the hardest decision I had to make last year. I studied 
journalism and fresh out of college I shared the frustration of many of my peers 
about the lack of good paying jobs in the field. I ended up starting over and 
going back to college to study statistics, which ironically opened many doors 
for me in the tech industry -- but also in data journalism, I field I didn't 
even know existed.

I used to juggle classes, an internship, data journalism projects as a 
freelancer, and baseball practice, and although I wasn't failing anything, I 
felt I wasn't giving my all to none of them. Then the covid pandemic struck, 
time warped and nothing made sense anymore. I somehow graduated (thanks to 
friends who studied with me and explained me SO many things), and I thought 
things would be quieter, but I just filled whatever time I had gotten back from 
classes with... more work. 

I couldn't say no to data journalism projects that were _so interesting_, but I
didn't want to forgo a formal job. So I kept stacking things up for years, 
having anxiety crises every other week -- did I mention I started a master's in
statistics because I missed studying? -- until last year I started having 
constant heartburn. I had gained 10 kg, I had stopped exercising (I still miss
baseball on Saturdays), and was constantly frustrated about "not having time" 
and doing everything half-assedly.

My therapist was suspicious of an undiagnosed ADHD, so on top of that I started
seeing a psychiatrist, and after a few months I made a deal with myself, my 
partner, my therapist and my psychiatrist: I had to let go of something.

So that's how I ended up having only one job for the first time in a decade! 
It was weird at first, but it unlocked a new joy: having time for weekly family
dinner with my niece. It's so simple but it makes me so happy that I wouldn't
give it up for anything, and I see that now.

## 2. Finishing my thesis in 2025

It's ridiculous that I've done all the credits for my MsC (I even took summer 
classes so I wouldn't be too swamped during the semester), but can't sit down to
write my thesis. It took me _months_ to decide on a theme, then I changed it 2 
or 3 times just for good measure, and once I settled... Nothing. I kept 
postponing and cancelling meetings with my advisor and now with the deadline 
looming, I decided to take a leave for a year. 

I'm lucky my advisor is so kind and understanding, and even suggested we keep 
working on it during this time if I wanted to, without the pressure of the 
deadline. I'm planning the next few months and we'll see how it goes. 

## 3. Home-cooked meals every single day

Some people don't care about food, as long as it's nourishing and/or tasty. I'm
not one of those people. I care deeply -- cooking and eating give me joy, 
whether it is with people or by myself. 

When I first moved out of my parent's house, I struggled to establish a routine 
that would allow for all the hassle that is cooking at home. Grocery shopping,
managing expiry dates, planning for the week, balancing nutrients -- it might be
simple, but it's a lot. But I eventually managed to find my rhythm. 

Then my partner moved in with me and... well, let's just say that those 10 kg I 
gained were not _only_ due to stress and anxiety. My eating habits changed, my 
metabolism changed with age, and in my mind I kept stressing that home-cooked
meal = good, everything else = bad.

I still like cooking, don't get me wrong. And I still think nothing beats a 
healthy homemade meal. But I admit now that, as much as I want to, I don't have
the time or energy to cook _every meal, everyday_. We do what we can, and when 
we can't, we use plans B or C (which is having a freezer stocked with packed 
lunch and ordering healthy-ish takeout). I also simplified groceries: I have a 
subscription that deliveries organic fruit, vegetables and eggs every two weeks, 
so we have less things to worry about when making a grocery list.

## 4. Being online all the time

I used to be a lot on Twitter (when it was still called that), Whatsapp groups, 
discord channels, Instagram. Nowadays, I can take from 2 hours to a whole day to
answer a text, to the frustration of my friends and family at first. Now they 
know that if something is important and can't wait for a few hours, they should 
_call_ me, like in the 1900s.

I keep forgetting my phone at home, the battery is out at least once a week 
because I forgot to check -- but I love it! I feel I _talk_ more with my family,
instead of just texting, and meet friends more regularly. I don't miss it, and I
think I would give up having a smartphone at all if I weren't so lost without 
Waze/Maps.

## Here's for a more intentional and less tiring year

So that's it. I still have some work to, but I feel proud that I took some steps 
towards a calmer and more focused year. Letting go used to feel like giving up, 
but I (finally!) learned that it doesn't have to be. I'm just making space for 
other great things, I'll mourn them but will not regret them.
