<p>Almost every year, I go through the same ritual of reflecting on what the past year meant to me, both on a professional and personal level. Accomplishments, work related projects and awards, things I learned, meaningful experiences, and so on.</p>
<p>I don’t usually share those reflections, limiting myself to Spotify Wrapped and other silly year-end summaries. However, I thought it would be nice to share something more personal this time around.</p>
<p>2025 was a <em>very busy</em> year. I’ve noticed that every year seems to get busier, but oh boy, I really <em>felt</em> it with my whole body this year. In January, I was three months into a new job, and I was still trying to get the hang of things, getting used to new processes (or lack thereof), and learning the ropes of a new team. Mind you, this was in addition to a part-time job I had been doing for almost a year already, and a master’s degree that I was still trying to finish.</p>
<p>My niece was born in December 2024, and all I wanted was to visit every week. I moved to a new apartment in March 2025. I had three international trips, attended three or four weddings, spoke at two major conferences, won a journalism award, got engaged, started (a few) new hobbies, started <em>planning</em> for a wedding, planning for a surprise birthday party for my sister, planning for I don’t know how many other things… It was a LOT.</p>
<p>So this year, I wanted to share some of the things I decided to let go in 2025, things that no longer fit in my life, not because I don’t like them anymore, but because I simply don’t have the time or energy to dedicate to them. It took me a while to finally accept that not only my time but also my energy is <em>finite</em> (shocking) and I really need to protect them both.</p>
<section id="working-two-jobs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="working-two-jobs">1. Working two jobs</h2>
<p>This was one of the hardest decision I had to make last year. I studied journalism and fresh out of college I shared the frustration of many of my peers about the lack of good paying jobs in the field. I ended up starting over and going back to college to study statistics, which ironically opened many doors for me in the tech industry – but also in data journalism, I field I didn’t even know existed.</p>
<p>I used to juggle classes, an internship, data journalism projects as a freelancer, and baseball practice, and although I wasn’t failing anything, I felt I wasn’t giving my all to none of them. Then the covid pandemic struck, time warped and nothing made sense anymore. I somehow graduated (thanks to friends who studied with me and explained me SO many things), and I thought things would be quieter, but I just filled whatever time I had gotten back from classes with… more work.</p>
<p>I couldn’t say no to data journalism projects that were <em>so interesting</em>, but I didn’t want to forgo a formal job. So I kept stacking things up for years, having anxiety crises every other week – did I mention I started a master’s in statistics because I missed studying? – until last year I started having constant heartburn. I had gained 10 kg, I had stopped exercising (I still miss baseball on Saturdays), and was constantly frustrated about “not having time” and doing everything half-assedly.</p>
<p>My therapist was suspicious of an undiagnosed ADHD, so on top of that I started seeing a psychiatrist, and after a few months I made a deal with myself, my partner, my therapist and my psychiatrist: I had to let go of something.</p>
<p>So that’s how I ended up having only one job for the first time in a decade! It was weird at first, but it unlocked a new joy: having time for weekly family dinner with my niece. It’s so simple but it makes me so happy that I wouldn’t give it up for anything, and I see that now.</p>

<section id="finishing-my-thesis-in-2025" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="finishing-my-thesis-in-2025">2. Finishing my thesis in 2025</h2>
<p>It’s ridiculous that I’ve done all the credits for my MsC (I even took summer classes so I wouldn’t be too swamped during the semester), but can’t sit down to write my thesis. It took me <em>months</em> to decide on a theme, then I changed it 2 or 3 times just for good measure, and once I settled… Nothing. I kept postponing and cancelling meetings with my advisor and now with the deadline looming, I decided to take a leave for a year.</p>
<p>I’m lucky my advisor is so kind and understanding, and even suggested we keep working on it during this time if I wanted to, without the pressure of the deadline. I’m planning the next few months and we’ll see how it goes.</p>
</section>
<section id="home-cooked-meals-every-single-day" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="home-cooked-meals-every-single-day">3. Home-cooked meals every single day</h2>
<p>Some people don’t care about food, as long as it’s nourishing and/or tasty. I’m not one of those people. I care deeply – cooking and eating give me joy, whether it is with people or by myself.</p>
<p>When I first moved out of my parent’s house, I struggled to establish a routine that would allow for all the hassle that is cooking at home. Grocery shopping, managing expiry dates, planning for the week, balancing nutrients – it might be simple, but it’s a lot. But I eventually managed to find my rhythm.</p>
<p>Then my partner moved in with me and… well, let’s just say that those 10 kg I gained were not <em>only</em> due to stress and anxiety. My eating habits changed, my metabolism changed with age, and in my mind I kept stressing that home-cooked meal = good, everything else = bad.</p>
<p>I still like cooking, don’t get me wrong. And I still think nothing beats a healthy homemade meal. But I admit now that, as much as I want to, I don’t have the time or energy to cook <em>every meal, everyday</em>. We do what we can, and when we can’t, we use plans B or C (which is having a freezer stocked with packed lunch and ordering healthy-ish takeout). I also simplified groceries: I have a subscription that deliveries organic fruit, vegetables and eggs every two weeks, so we have less things to worry about when making a grocery list.</p>
</section>
<section id="being-online-all-the-time" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="being-online-all-the-time">4. Being online all the time</h2>
<p>I used to be a lot on Twitter (when it was still called that), Whatsapp groups, discord channels, Instagram. Nowadays, I can take from 2 hours to a whole day to answer a text, to the frustration of my friends and family at first. Now they know that if something is important and can’t wait for a few hours, they should <em>call</em> me, like in the 1900s.</p>
<p>I keep forgetting my phone at home, the battery is out at least once a week because I forgot to check – but I love it! I feel I <em>talk</em> more with my family, instead of just texting, and meet friends more regularly. I don’t miss it, and I think I would give up having a smartphone at all if I weren’t so lost without Waze/Maps.</p>
</section>
<section id="heres-for-a-more-intentional-and-less-tiring-year" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="heres-for-a-more-intentional-and-less-tiring-year">Here’s for a more intentional and less tiring year</h2>
<p>So that’s it. I still have some work to, but I feel proud that I took some steps towards a calmer and more focused year. Letting go used to feel like giving up, but I (finally!) learned that it doesn’t have to be. I’m just making space for other great things, I’ll mourn them but will not regret them.</p>
